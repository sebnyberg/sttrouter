# Principles

## Progressive Simplicity

**Principle**: Start with the simplest solution that works, then evolve complexity only when justified by real needs.

**Application**:

- Begin with minimal modular structure and flat organization
- Add abstractions only when patterns emerge and reuse is evident
- Expand to separate components when clear boundaries justify the complexity
- Resist premature optimization and over-engineering

**Decision Framework**:

- Choose the simplest design that meets current requirements
- Defer complex solutions until their necessity is proven
- Measure complexity cost against actual benefits
- Favor maintainability over theoretical flexibility

## Early Validation

**Principle**: Validate configuration parameters and inputs as early in the system as possible, eliminating the need for defensive validation in submodules.

**Application**:

- Validate all CLI arguments, flags, and configuration at the `cmd/` layer entry points
- Centralize validation logic at system boundaries (CLI parsing, API gateways, service initialization)
- Apply fail-fast philosophy to catch configuration errors before processing begins

**Decision Framework**:

- Place validation at the outermost system boundaries where context is richest
- Design internal APIs to assume valid inputs, reducing defensive programming overhead
- Centralize validation rules to ensure consistency and easier maintenance
- Provide meaningful error messages with full context about validation failures
